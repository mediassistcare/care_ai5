# Medical Assessment System Updates - Step 7 Enhancements

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Differential Questions (`prompts/differential_question.txt`)

**Key Improvements:**
- **Highly Targeted Questions**: Updated prompt to generate clinically specific questions targeting unique pathophysiology, symptoms, or diagnostic criteria
- **Non-Repetitive Design**: Added specific instructions to avoid generic questions and repetitive patterns
- **Added "I don't know" Option**: All questions now include "Yes", "No", and "I don't know" as answer options to account for clinical uncertainty
- **Specific Targeting Strategies**: Added detailed guidance for focusing on:
  - Unique pathophysiology and organ involvement
  - Distinctive clinical presentations
  - Specific diagnostic test results
  - Unique temporal patterns or disease progression
  - Condition-specific risk factors
  - Unique anatomical locations or system involvement

**Technical Changes:**
- Enhanced the question generation prompt with more specific medical guidance
- Added requirement for "I don't know" option in all answer choices
- Improved reasoning requirements to target condition-specific features
- Added anti-repetition mechanisms to ensure unique question generation

### 2. Enhanced System Instructions (`prompts/differential_question_system.txt`)

**Improvements:**
- Added detailed instructions for creating clinically unique questions
- Emphasized targeting specific pathophysiological mechanisms
- Added requirements for avoiding repetitive questioning patterns
- Enhanced focus on diagnostic relevance and clinical actionability

### 3. PDF Report Generation (`app_new.py`)

**Major Enhancement - Professional PDF Reports:**
- **Complete PDF Generation**: Replaced simple JSON download with comprehensive PDF reports
- **Professional Layout**: Implemented structured, well-formatted medical report layout using ReportLab
- **Comprehensive Content**: Includes:
  - Patient information summary
  - Complete assessment steps (Steps 1-7)
  - Clinical summary and findings
  - ICD-11 diagnosis codes with confidence levels
  - Differential diagnosis process history
  - Professional styling with colors, tables, and formatting

**Technical Implementation:**
- Added ReportLab dependency to requirements.txt
- Created structured PDF generation with professional medical report format
- Implemented proper table formatting for ICD codes and patient data
- Added comprehensive error handling for PDF generation
- Professional styling with custom fonts, colors, and layout

### 4. Dependencies Update (`requirements.txt`)

**Added:**
- `reportlab>=4.0.0` for PDF generation capabilities

## Features Enhanced

### Differential Questions (Step 7)
1. **More Targeted Questions**: Questions now focus on unique clinical features specific to each ICD code
2. **Uncertainty Handling**: "I don't know" option allows users to express clinical uncertainty
3. **Anti-Repetition**: Built-in mechanisms to prevent repetitive question patterns
4. **Clinical Precision**: Questions target specific pathophysiology and diagnostic criteria

### PDF Report Download
1. **Professional Format**: Clean, medical-grade PDF reports with proper formatting
2. **Comprehensive Content**: All assessment data organized in logical sections
3. **Visual Enhancement**: Tables, colors, and professional styling
4. **Complete Documentation**: Includes differential diagnosis process and reasoning
5. **Proper File Naming**: Auto-generated filenames with timestamps
